Let’s clarify Queue vs Topic, which are core concepts in messaging systems like JMS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.

## 1. Queue (Point-to-Point Messaging)

- Definition: A queue is a message channel where messages are stored until a consumer retrieves them.
- Key characteristics:
  - Each message is consumed by only one consumer.
  - Messages are processed in order (FIFO – First In, First Out).
  - Useful for task distribution, workload balancing, or job processing.
- Example: Bank transaction processing
  - Each transaction message goes into a queue.
  - Only one worker/service processes each transaction.

```text
Queue: TransactionQueue
Producer -> [Transaction1, Transaction2, Transaction3] -> Consumer
```
- Multiple consumers can read from the queue, but each message is delivered to only one consumer.

## 2. Topic (Publish/Subscribe Messaging)

- Definition: A topic is a message channel where messages are broadcast to all subscribers.
- Key characteristics:
  - Messages are delivered to all active subscribers.
  - Useful for broadcast events, like notifications, news, or real-time updates.
  - Subscribers can join or leave anytime (durable subscribers can get messages sent while they were offline).
- Example: Bank notifications.
  - When a deposit occurs, all interested services or clients (email, SMS, push notification) get notified.
``` text
Topic: DepositNotification
Producer -> [Deposit100, Deposit200] -> Subscriber1 (Email)
                                  -> Subscriber2 (SMS)
                                  -> Subscriber3 (Push)
```
- Each subscriber receives its own copy of the message.

| Feature          | Queue                              | Topic                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Messaging model  | Point-to-Point                     | Publish/Subscribe                 |
| Message delivery | One consumer per message           | All subscribers get the message   |
| Use case         | Task processing, work distribution | Notifications, event broadcasting |
| Example          | Transaction processing queue       | Deposit notifications topic       |
