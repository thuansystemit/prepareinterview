# The 3 Pillars of Scrum

In **Scrum**, the **three pillars** are the foundation of **empirical process control** (how Scrum manages work).

## 1. Transparency
- Everyone involved must have a clear and shared understanding of the work and process.  
- Information should be visible and accessible (e.g., Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Definition of Done).  
- Prevents misunderstandings and builds trust.  

## 2. Inspection
- Scrum artifacts and progress toward goals should be inspected frequently.  
- Helps identify issues, risks, or deviations early.  
- Examples: Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective.  

## 3. Adaptation
- If inspection reveals problems or opportunities, the team must adapt.  
- Adjust plans, processes, or practices to stay on track with goals.  
- Ensures continuous improvement.  

ðŸ‘‰ These three pillars (**Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation**) work together to make Scrum effective.


# The 5 Scrum Values

Scrum is built on **five core values** that guide how people work together within the framework.

## 1. Commitment
- Team members personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team.  
- Builds trust and responsibility.  

## 2. Focus
- Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team.  
- Minimizes distractions and increases productivity.  

## 3. Openness
- The Scrum Team and stakeholders agree to be open about the work and challenges.  
- Encourages transparency and better collaboration.  

## 4. Respect
- Team members respect each other as capable, independent people.  
- Creates a safe and supportive environment.  

## 5. Courage
- Team members have the courage to do the right thing, work on tough problems, and speak up.  
- Drives innovation and improvement.  

ðŸ‘‰ These values support the **3 Pillars of Scrum (Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation)** and enable teams to succeed.


# Scrum Roles, Events, and Artifacts

Scrum is defined by **roles**, **events**, and **artifacts** that provide structure and enable transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

---

## Scrum Roles
Scrum defines **three accountabilities** (roles):

1. **Product Owner**
   - Responsible for maximizing the value of the product.  
   - Manages the **Product Backlog** (clear goals, priorities, and transparency).  

2. **Scrum Master**
   - Servant-leader for the Scrum Team.  
   - Ensures Scrum is understood and enacted.  
   - Helps remove impediments and facilitates collaboration.  

3. **Developers**
   - Professionals doing the work of delivering a usable Increment each Sprint.  
   - Self-managing, cross-functional, and accountable for creating the **Increment**.  

---

## Scrum Events
Each Sprint contains all of the Scrum events:

1. **Sprint**
   - The heartbeat of Scrum, a time-box (usually 2â€“4 weeks).  
   - Creates a usable, valuable **Increment** each Sprint.  

2. **Sprint Planning**
   - Defines the Sprint Goal, what can be delivered, and how it will be achieved.  

3. **Daily Scrum**
   - A 15-minute event for Developers to inspect progress and adapt the plan.  

4. **Sprint Review**
   - Inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog.  
   - Stakeholders collaborate with the Scrum Team.  

5. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - Inspect how the last Sprint went regarding people, processes, and tools.  
   - Plan improvements for the next Sprint.  

---

## Scrum Artifacts
Artifacts provide transparency and opportunities for inspection/adaptation:

1. **Product Backlog**
   - An ordered list of everything needed in the product.  
   - Owned by the Product Owner.  

2. **Sprint Backlog**
   - The plan for the Sprint, including the Sprint Goal, selected Product Backlog items, and a plan for delivering them.  
   - Owned by the Developers.  

3. **Increment**
   - The sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a Sprint.  
   - Must meet the **Definition of Done** and be usable.

# Sample Scrum Exam-Style Q&A

Here are three practice questions and answers that could appear in a Scrum Master exam.

---

### Question 1
**Interviewer Question:**  
What are the three pillars of Scrum, and why are they important?  

**User Answer:**  
The three pillars of Scrum are **Transparency, Inspection, and Adaptation**.  
- **Transparency** ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of progress and goals.  
- **Inspection** allows the team to regularly check progress and detect issues early.  
- **Adaptation** enables the team to make changes based on inspection results, ensuring continuous improvement.  
Together, they support empirical process control and make Scrum effective.  

---

### Question 2
**Interviewer Question:**  
During a Sprint, who is responsible for managing the Sprint Backlog?  

**User Answer:**  
The **Developers** are responsible for managing the Sprint Backlog.  
They decide how to turn selected Product Backlog items into a usable Increment. The Sprint Backlog is **owned and updated only by the Developers**, ensuring they have autonomy and accountability over the work.  

---

### Question 3
**Interviewer Question:**  
What is the purpose of the Sprint Review, and who should attend?  

**User Answer:**  
The purpose of the **Sprint Review** is to inspect the Increment and adapt the **Product Backlog** if needed. Itâ€™s a collaborative working session where the Scrum Team and stakeholders discuss what was done in the Sprint and what might be next.  
- **Attendees:** The **Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers**, and **key stakeholders**.  
- Outcome: A revised Product Backlog that reflects new opportunities and priorities.
