### Week 1: Foundation

  - Focus on the 3 pillars, 5 values, roles, events, and artifacts.
- **Take notes in your own words.** Summarize each section.
- **Watch intro videos** on Scrum (Scrum.org, YouTube, or Scrum Alliance).
- **Daily practice:** Write 3 sample exam-style Q&A for yourself.

### Week 2: Deep Dive into Scrum
- **Scrum roles in detail:**
  - Scrum Master responsibilities (servant leader, coach, impediment remover)
  - Difference between Product Owner and Scrum Master
- **Scrum Events:** Timeboxes, purpose, outputs, attendees
- **Scrum Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment, commitments (DoR, DoD, Sprint Goal)
- **Practice open assessments** on [Scrum.org Open Assessments](https://www.scrum.org/open-assessments) daily until scoring 95–100%.
- **Read blogs/case studies** about real Scrum implementations.

### Week 3: Practice & Tricky Questions
- Focus on **exam-style practice questions**:
  - Timeboxed sprints vs canceling sprints
  - Can Product Owner change sprint backlog? (No, only developers)
  - Scrum Master role in scaling, coaching, organizational change
- Use **mock exams** (MPlaza, Volkerdon, Scrum.org sample tests)
