Resolving a conflict between two team members requires a structured, fair, and calm approach. Here’s a step-by-step guide you can follow:

## 1. Address the conflict early
- Don’t let tensions fester. Early intervention prevents escalation.
- Observe signs: reduced collaboration, arguments, withdrawal, low morale.

## 2. Create a safe space for discussion
- Meet privately with both parties, or separately at first if needed.
- Ensure a neutral, calm environment.
- Emphasize that the goal is resolution, not blame.

## 3. Listen to both sides
- Let each person explain their perspective without interruption.
- Use active listening:
  - Paraphrase: “So you feel that… because…”
  - Show empathy: “I understand why that situation frustrated you.”

## 4. Identify the root cause
- Conflicts often arise from:
  - Miscommunication or misunderstanding
  - Different work styles
  - Role ambiguity
  - Personality clashes
- Clarify facts vs. emotions.

## 5. Encourage collaboration and mutual understanding
- Ask both members: “What would a fair solution look like?”
- Focus on common goals (team success, project deadlines).

## 6. Propose solutions
- Options can include:
  - Clarifying roles/responsibilities
  - Setting boundaries or rules for collaboration
  - Adjusting workload or reporting lines
  - Mediated compromise (e.g., alternating tasks)

## 7. Agree on action steps
- Document the agreed solution.
- Set clear expectations and responsibilities.
- Define a timeline for follow-up.

## 8. Follow up
- Check in periodically to ensure the solution is working.
- Offer coaching or training if conflict stems from skill gaps (e.g., communication, teamwork).

**Tips for Managers**

- Stay neutral; avoid taking sides.
- Encourage professional behavior, not personal attacks.
- Promote team-building activities to improve relationships.
- Use HR or conflict-resolution specialists for persistent or serious conflicts.
